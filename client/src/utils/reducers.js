// A reducer is a function that updates state by returning a new state object and never
// alters the original state object. Now, that doesn't mean the data inside the state object
// isn't altered. Of course, it isâ€”why else would we need to update state? The key takeaway
// here is that state is intended to be immutable, meaning it never should be directly altered
// in any way. The reason for this is that it goes behind the state management system's back
// and it isn't informed that something has changed.

import {
  UPDATE_PRODUCTS,
  UPDATE_CATEGORIES,
  UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY,
} from "./actions";

export const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // if action type value is the value of ' UPDATE_PRODUCTS', return a  new state object with an updated products array
    case UPDATE_PRODUCTS:
      return {
        ...state,
        products: [...action.products],
      };

    // if action type value is the value of `UPDATE_CATEGORIES`, return a new state object with an updated categories array
    case UPDATE_CATEGORIES:
      return {

    case UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY:
      return {

        currentCategory: action.currentCategory,

// This function, useProductReducer(), will be used to help initialize our global state object and then provide us with the 
// functionality for updating that state by automatically running it through our custom reducer() function. Think of this as 
// a more in-depth way of using the useState() Hook we've used so much.

// The useState() Hook is great for managing simpler amounts of state, like form field values and the status of a button being 
// licked. The useReducer() Hook is meant specifically for managing a greater level of state,
